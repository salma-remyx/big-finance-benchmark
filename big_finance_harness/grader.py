"""Rubric-based judge.

The grader takes the trace of a run, the dataset item the run targets, and a judge model
identifier. It returns a `GradedRun` with one binary score per rubric line plus a binary
final-answer-correctness score.

The judge is asked, in a single structured call per question, to:
  1. Decide whether the model's `final_answer` matches the reference answer.
  2. For each rubric line, decide whether the trace evidences that the line was satisfied.

The judge sees: the question, the reference answer, the rubric, the model's final answer,
and the assistant text + tool calls + tool results from the full trace. The judge does
NOT see the points associated with each line — points are aggregated client-side after
grading so the judge can't be biased toward heavy-weight items.

Inter-judge agreement: callers should grade with at least two non-evaluated judges and
report Cohen's kappa; this module grades with one judge per call.
